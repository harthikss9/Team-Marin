Colons can be used to align columns.

| Task       | Who           | Status  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| ER diagram      | Nitin, Harthik | Completed |
| Use Case diagram     | Charan Sai, Srija       |   Completed |
| User Stories | Nitin, Harthik      |    Completed |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
